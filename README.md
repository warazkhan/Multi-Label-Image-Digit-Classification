# Multi-Label Image-Based Digit Classification

This project aims to develop a deep learning model for **multi-label digit classification** using images containing multiple overlapping digits. The methodology involves **image preprocessing**, **feature extraction**, **CNN model training**, and **evaluation**.

## üìÇ Dataset Overview
Each image in the dataset contains **three MNIST digits**, requiring the model to detect and classify multiple digits within a single image. The digits may be **overlapping** or partially **obscured**, increasing classification difficulty.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Workflow

### 1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**
- **Resize**: Images are resized to a uniform dimension (28x28).
- **Grayscale Conversion**: Convert images to grayscale for consistency.
- **Gaussian Blurring**: Applied to smooth images and reduce noise.
- **Thresholding**: Convert the image into binary to simplify digit detection.
- **Morphological Operations**: Erosion and dilation help separate overlapping digits.
- **Region of Interest (ROI) Segmentation**: Extracts individual digits from the image.
- **Normalization**: Pixel values are normalized for better model performance.

### 2. **Model Development**
- **CNN Architecture**: A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used, with the ability to adapt and experiment with different architectures to improve accuracy.
- **Data Augmentation**: Used to introduce variations and enhance model generalization.

### 3. **Evaluation & Hyperparameter Tuning**
- **Cross-Validation**: n-fold cross-validation ensures robust model evaluation.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search is used to optimize hyperparameters for the best performance.
- **Early Stopping**: Prevents overfitting by monitoring performance on the validation set.

### 4. **Performance Metrics**
- **Accuracy**: Measures the overall performance.
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**: Additional metrics used to evaluate model performance, especially in multi-label scenarios.
